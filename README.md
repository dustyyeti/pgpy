# pgpy-trix
Demo a PGP client-side GUI using [PGPy: Pretty Good Privacy for Python](https://github.com/SecurityInnovation/PGPy)

## Motivation
It's too common for interent users to rely on the security standards of the consumer applications they run. Cleartext in form fields will follow the protocols of the black-box application, leaving users vulnerble to the whims and failures of the developers. 

This tool demonstrates PGPy's capability to generate in-app client-side primary key RSA, DSA or ECDSA, or load your existing key from file. Use the key to encrypt and decrypt

## Software

Written for Python3, requires:

* hexdump==3.3
* PGPy==0.5.4
* PySimpleGUI==4.60.4
